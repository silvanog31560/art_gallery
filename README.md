# art_gallery

This is my first project, I created this to practice what I have learned in Django. This is a virtual art gallery 
where the site owner can upload different style art in different categories. I used imagekit to create different sized images and to give the owner 
the ability to watermark the images. I used Stripe to process the payments but it is not live either. There is a contact page to send the site owner 
a message and a review page as well.
